# elysium

```
the world's end, the Elysian Fields,
Where gold-haired Rhadamanthys waits,
Where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man;
No snow, no winter onslaught, never a downpour there
But night and day the Ocean River sends up breezes,
Singing winds of the West refreshing all mankind. 

- Odyssey by Homer, translated by Robert Fagles
